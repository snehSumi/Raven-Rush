# Raven-Rush
Shoot the irritating ravens!

- "Raven Rush" was created using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. The combination of these technologies allowed for the development of an interactive and visually appealing game that can be played directly in a web browser.

- The game incorporates collision detection to determine when the player's interaction (click or tap) hits a raven. When a collision occurs, the raven is marked for deletion, the player's score is incremented, and an explosion effect is triggered.
